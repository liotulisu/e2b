## Downloading Pathloss 5
 
To download Pathloss 5, you will need a license email from CTE that contains your serial number and links for downloading the program and the updates. If you have not purchased Pathloss 5 yet, please contact CTE for information on how to do so.
 
Once you have your license email, use the links in the email to download the program. This will always download the most recent release of Pathloss 5. You can also download the updates separately if you need to update an existing installation.
 
## Installing Pathloss 5
 
Pathloss 5 is compatible with Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8/10 operating systems. The installation process is simple and straightforward. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Run the pl5\_setup.exe file that you downloaded from the license email.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to install the program on your computer.
3. If you are using Windows Vista or later, you may need to run the setup file as Administrator. To do this, right-click on the pl5\_setup icon and select Run As Administrator.

## Initializing Pathloss 5
 
After installing Pathloss 5, you will need to initialize it with your serial number before you can use it. A single Pathloss 5 license can be initialized on only one computer at a time. To move a license from one computer to another, you must uninitialize it from the first computer before initializing it on the second. The program does not need to be uninstalled from either computer.
 
To initialize Pathloss 5, follow these steps:

1. Start the program.
2. Click the Initialize program menu item. A new dialog box will appear.
3. Enter the serial number from your license email and click the blue arrow button. If the Program initialization does not expand, the serial number has not been entered correctly.
4. Select an initialization option. If an internet connection is available, select "Internet connection" and click the blue arrow button. The program will process the initialization automatically.
5. If an internet connection is not available, select one of the other options: "Email", "Fax", or "Phone". An installation code will be created when the serial number has been entered. Copy this code and send it to cte@pathloss.com by email, fax, or phone. An authorization code will be returned by CTE. Enter this code in the Program initialization dialog box and click the blue arrow button.

## Updating Pathloss 5
 
To keep your Pathloss 5 program up to date with the latest features and bug fixes, you should update it regularly. Updating means changing to a later build of the program. Updates are always free of charge and can be downloaded from the link in your license email.
 
To update Pathloss 5, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest update file from the link in your license email.
2. Run the update file and follow the on-screen prompts to install it on your computer.
